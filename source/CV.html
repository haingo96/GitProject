        <span class="subject">Background</span>
        <span>: </span>
        <span class="content">Conan Edogawa is Shinichi Kudo's alter ego. He did not exist before the chain of events, involving members of the Black Organization, that led Shinichi to transform back into a child.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="subject">Personality</span>
        <span>: </span>
        <span class="content">As Conan, Shinichi tries to behave like a child. He refers to Ran as "Ran-neechan" (nee-chan meaning older sister, a common nickname Japanese children give to teenagers and young adults they look up to), and refers to Shinichi as "Shinichi-niichan" (nii-chan meaning older brother). He also refers to Kogoro as "Oji-san" or "Occhan" (both meaning Uncle), although he also does this as Shinichi. As Shinichi, he refers to Conan as usually "Conan-kun" or the "Kid in the Glasses". Shinichi treats Conan as a separate person completely, thinking for example, "changing back into Conan".</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span class="subject">Skills</span>
        <span>: </span>
        <span class="content">All of Shinichi's detective skills carry over to his Conan form, although Conan does not have the reputation Shinichi had. He repeatedly demonstrates the ability to remember every detail of an investigation or other topics he cares about and may have a photographic memory to manage such perfect recall so consistently. Conan's fastidious attention to detail allows him to notice minor inconsistencies in crime scenes and suspect testimony that other people miss, and using astute logic he uncovers the reasons behind those inconsistencies to link them to the crime. Conan has an extraordinarily broad knowledge of many subjects and trivia that help him solve cases; something he likely acquired from his incessant reading in his "first childhood". There are only a few people like Heiji, Saguru and Yusaku who are at the same detective level as Conan, with Yusaku, be the only person who is noticeably better than Conan.</span>
